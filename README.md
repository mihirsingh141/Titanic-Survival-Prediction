# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Data

Pclass: Passenger's socio-economic status

Name: Passenger's name

Sex: Passenger's sex

Age: This can also be fractional

SibSp: The number of siblings and spouse of the passenger

Parch: Indicates whether the passenger's parents or children were aboard as well

Ticket: Passenger's ticket number

Fare: Ticket fare

Cabin: Passenger's Cabin number

Embarked: Passenger's point of embarkment

## Conclusion

The Random Forest Classifier model works the best. It produced an accuracy of greater than 0.79
